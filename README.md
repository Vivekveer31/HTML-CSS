# HTML & CSS Projects – My First Step in Web Development

This was my **first step into web development**. While learning HTML and CSS, I built multiple small projects to understand the **fundamentals of web page structure, styling, and responsive layouts**.

Even though these projects are “simple,” they were crucial in building the foundation for **JavaScript, React, and real-world client projects**.
